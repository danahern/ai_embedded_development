# nRF54L15 Learnings

- **Use .hex not .elf for flashing** — probe-rs fails with ELF on RRAM. Use `flash_program` with `.hex`.
- **connect_under_reset=true for stuck states** — RRAM can get stuck; connect under reset recovers.
- **RRAM is 1524KB (0x17D000)** — Default storage fills to end; must shrink to fit coredump partition.
- **flash_program works without prior erase** — .hex flashing works directly, no erase step needed.
- **run_firmware (erase+program) fails on RRAM** — Don't use the combined flow.
