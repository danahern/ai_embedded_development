title: CLAUDE.md should stay under 8 KB for context window efficiency
body: 'The workspace CLAUDE.md grew to 18.6 KB with MCP tool reference tables, board tables, and 7 workflow examples — all duplicating info already in individual server CLAUDE.md files and knowledge/boards/*.yml. Trimmed to 8 KB by: removing MCP tool tables (5.2 KB savings — server descriptions provide this), removing Common Boards table (use knowledge.board_info()), removing Permission Rules section, trimming workflows from 7 to 3, and condensing Plans/Workspace/Documentation sections. Rule: CLAUDE.md = policy + gotchas + commands, not a reference manual.'
