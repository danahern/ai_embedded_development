title: "Don't duplicate board overlays \u2014 use library's boards/ directory"
body: |
  When a library (e.g. crash_log) provides board-specific DTS overlays in its `boards/` directory, apps should NOT copy those overlays into their own `boards/` directory. Zephyr auto-discovers overlays from the app's `boards/` dir, but the library's overlays are included via `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` in CMakeLists.txt. Duplicating them causes maintenance drift and confusion about which is authoritative.
