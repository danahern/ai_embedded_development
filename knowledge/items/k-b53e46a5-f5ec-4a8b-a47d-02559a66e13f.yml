title: JLink SetRESET/ClrRESET drives nRESET pin for full SoC reset on Alif E7
body: |-
  JLink Commander's SetRESET and ClrRESET commands drive the hardware nRESET pin directly, triggering a full SoC reset including the Secure Enclave. This is unlike the `r` (Reset) command which only does a debug/core reset of the connected CPU.

  Usage (no debug connection required):
    JLinkExe -device Cortex-A32 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 0 -nogui 1
    SetRESET      ← assert nRESET (drive low)
    sleep 200     ← hold reset for 200ms
    ClrRESET      ← release nRESET (drive high)

  The -autoconnect 0 flag prevents JLink from trying to establish a debug connection (which may fail if the CPU is in a bad state). The reset pin toggle works regardless.

  After nRESET release, the SE boot sequence observed via JLink VCOM:
  - ~170ms: Binary SEROM data on UART
  - ~260ms: "[SES] STOC DEVICE ok", "[SES] No LF XTAL", "[SES] SERAM bank valid"
  - ~280ms: "[SES] ATOC DEVICE ok", "[SES] STOC ok", "[SES] ATOC ok", "[SES] LCS=1"
  - ~310ms: Firewall region table
  - ~340ms: A32 starts, kernel crash → firewall exception flood begins

  Total boot-to-crash: ~340ms after nRESET release.
  ISP window (if any): between SES idle state and firewall flood (~60ms).

  Note: The JLink `r` command requires `RSetType 2` to use reset pin mode, but `SetRESET`/`ClrRESET` work directly without a debug connection.
