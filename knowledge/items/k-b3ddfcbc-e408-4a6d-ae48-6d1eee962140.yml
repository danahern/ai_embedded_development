title: regenerate_gotchas() now requires validated status
body: The regenerate_gotchas() function in knowledge-server now filters by `status == "validated"` in addition to `severity == "critical"` and `!deprecated`. Only validated critical items reach Tier 1 (CLAUDE.md Key Gotchas). The output JSON includes `unvalidated_critical_count` and `unvalidated_critical` array showing items excluded due to unvalidated status. This prevents unvetted advice from being promoted to always-in-context gotchas.
