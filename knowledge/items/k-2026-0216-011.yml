title: 'RTT buffer drops: increase SEGGER_RTT_BUFFER_SIZE_UP for deferred reading'
body: Default SEGGER_RTT_BUFFER_SIZE_UP is 1024 bytes. If no host reader is attached, the buffer fills with boot messages and all subsequent log messages are silently dropped (no-block-skip mode). Set `CONFIG_SEGGER_RTT_BUFFER_SIZE_UP=4096` to retain more messages for post-hoc reading. Also set `CONFIG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=4096` for the deferred log buffer.
