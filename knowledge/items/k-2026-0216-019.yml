title: Per-board build directories in zephyr-build MCP
body: Build directories changed from `apps/<name>/build/` to `apps/<name>/build/<board_sanitized>/` where `/` in board names becomes `_` (e.g., `nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp` → `nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`). This prevents building for one board from wiping another board's artifacts. `clean(app)` removes all board builds; `clean(app, board)` removes just one. `list_apps()` now returns `built_boards` array instead of single `board` field.
