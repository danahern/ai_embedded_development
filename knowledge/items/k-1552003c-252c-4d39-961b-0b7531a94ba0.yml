title: Alif E7 SE boot sequence and ISP timing from UART capture
body: |-
  Full SE boot sequence captured on SE-UART (55000 baud) after nRESET:

  Timeline (relative to nRESET deassert):
  1. ~170ms: Binary SEROM output (non-ASCII diagnostic data)
  2. ~260ms: SES text output begins:
     - "[SES] STOC DEVICE ok"
     - "[SES] No LF XTAL" (no low-frequency crystal)
     - "[SES] Bank 0x0 marked booted"
     - "[SES] SERAM bank 0x0 is valid and booted"
  3. ~280ms: ATOC processing:
     - "[SES] ATOC DEVICE ok"
     - "[SES] STOC ok"
     - "[SES] ATOC ok"
     - "[SES] LCS=1" (Lifecycle State)
     - "[SES] FC:Rgn.0:2 4:0 4:1 5:0 5:1 7:0 7:1 8:0 8:1 9:0 9:1 11:0 11:1 12:0 12:1 13:0 13:1 13:2"
  4. ~310ms: Firewall region table printed
  5. ~340ms: A32 started, kernel crashes → continuous FC5 firewall exceptions:
     "Firewall exception from FC5, caused by Master ID 0x01 at address 0x025FF000"
     "Firewall exception from FC5, caused by Master ID 0x01 at address 0x027DDFC0"

  Key observations:
  - SE does NOT accept ISP commands during SEROM/SES boot sequence
  - ISP handler only active after SES enters command loop (post-ATOC)
  - Total boot-to-crash is ~340ms, leaving ~60ms theoretical ISP window
  - Firewall exceptions are continuous (A32 stuck in fault retry loop)
  - FC5 = SRAM firewall, Master ID 0x01 = A32 core
  - Both 0x025FF000 and 0x027DDFC0 are beyond actual 4MB SRAM boundary
