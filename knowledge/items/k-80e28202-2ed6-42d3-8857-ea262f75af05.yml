title: 'STM32MP1: Serial base64 transfer impractical for files over 10KB'
body: |-
  Transferring files over serial (115200 baud) via base64 echo/printf commands is extremely slow. A 5.5KB file takes ~15 seconds; a 328KB static binary would take 10+ minutes.

  Better alternatives: 1) USB gadget CDC-ECM then SCP/SSH, 2) SD card mount via debugfs on macOS, 3) Wired Ethernet, 4) XMODEM/ZMODEM over serial.
