title: nRF7002-DK requires nrfutil for flash, probe-rs fails on nRF5340
body: probe-rs cannot reliably connect to the nRF5340 on the nRF7002-DK due to APPROTECT. Use `nrfutil device recover` to clear APPROTECT, then `nrfutil device program --firmware <hex> --core Application --traits jlink` for flashing. probe-rs can attach after recovery for RTT reading but may interfere with BLE advertising. Disconnect probe-rs before BLE operations. Use `nrfutil` (not `nrfjprog`) — it's the modern Nordic CLI tool.
