title: 'STM32MP1: Buildroot toolchain glibc mismatch with OpenSTLinux SD card'
body: |-
  The Buildroot Docker container (stm32mp1-sdk) cross-compiles against glibc 2.34+, but the OpenSTLinux SD card image has an older glibc. Dynamically linked binaries fail with: /lib/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.34 not found

  Fix: Use -static in LDFLAGS. For larger apps, rebuild the SD card from the same Buildroot or use the matching Yocto SDK.
