title: zephyr-build build_status returns excessive output
body: 'The `build_status()` MCP tool returns the full build log (all compiler invocations), which can exceed 70K characters and trigger the "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" error. The tool should either truncate to the last N lines (cmake summary + memory region) or provide a summary mode. Workaround: use python3/jq to extract the success status and memory usage from the saved file.'
