title: hw-test-runner MCP decouples BLE testing from probe-rs
body: 'The hw-test-runner Python MCP server provides BLE and TCP testing that runs independently of probe-rs. BLE uses bleak (CoreBluetooth on macOS), so there''s no J-Link conflict. This eliminates the disconnect/reconnect cycle when alternating between RTT debugging and BLE testing. Key tools: ble_discover, ble_read, ble_write, ble_subscribe, wifi_provision, wifi_scan_aps, wifi_status, wifi_factory_reset, tcp_throughput. Registered in .mcp.json with its own .venv.'
