title: GitHub Actions runner requires restart after .env changes
body: |-
  The self-hosted GitHub Actions runner reads `~/actions-runner/.env` at startup only. Adding new environment variables (like `IDF_PATH`) requires restarting the runner service:

  ```bash
  cd ~/actions-runner
  sudo ./svc.sh stop
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  ```

  Without restart, new env vars are not visible to workflow jobs even though the file is updated. This caused the esp32-test job to fail with "IDF_PATH not set" despite the variable being correctly added to .env.
