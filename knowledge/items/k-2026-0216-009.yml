title: 'nRF7002-DK dual-core: hci_ipc needed on net core for BLE'
body: 'The nRF7002-DK uses nRF5340 dual-core. BLE runs via IPC from app core to net core. The net core needs `hci_ipc` firmware: `west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpunet zephyr/samples/bluetooth/hci_ipc`. Flash with `nrfutil device program --firmware zephyr.hex --core Network --traits jlink`. Without hci_ipc, BLE init fails with HCI error -11 (EAGAIN).'
