title: 'UUID byte order: Zephyr and NimBLE both use little-endian internally'
body: |-
  Both Zephyr `bt_uuid_128.val[]` and NimBLE `ble_uuid128_t.value[]` store 128-bit UUIDs in little-endian byte order (BLE wire format). Direct memcpy works for both — no byte reversal needed.

  This means eai_ble's `eai_ble_uuid128_t` (little-endian) can be copied directly into either backend:
  ```c
  // Zephyr backend
  memcpy(dst->val, src->bytes, 16);  // No reversal

  // NimBLE backend
  memcpy(dst->value, src->bytes, 16);  // No reversal
  ```

  The original plan suggested Zephyr might need big-endian reversal, but testing confirmed both use LE internally.
