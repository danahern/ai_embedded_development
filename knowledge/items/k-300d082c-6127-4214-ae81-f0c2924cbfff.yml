title: Alif E7 hard maintenance mode recovery via SETOOLS maintenance tool
body: |-
  When an Alif E7 board is "bricked" (bad application causes crash that floods SE-UART with firewall exceptions), use Hard Maintenance Mode to recover:

  1. Run: ./maintenance -d
  2. Select serial port (e.g. /dev/cu.usbmodem...)
  3. Select "1 - Device Control"
  4. Select "1 - Hard maintenance mode"
  5. Press the physical RESET button on the board when prompted
  6. Press ENTER twice to exit

  Hard maintenance mode:
  - Always restores SE-UART functionality
  - No CPU cores boot except Secure Enclave
  - Stops buggy applications from continuously rebooting

  After entering maintenance mode:
  - Erase app MRAM: ./app-write-mram -e app
  - Or directly reflash: ./app-gen-toc && ./app-write-mram

  Alternative erase via maintenance menu:
  1. ./maintenance → select port
  2. Select "3 - MRAM"
  3. Select "3 - Fast Erase App. Mram (include NTOC)"

  The maintenance tool does NOT set the maintenance flag if SE doesn't respond initially. It just waits for a fresh boot (RESET button press) to catch the ISP window.
