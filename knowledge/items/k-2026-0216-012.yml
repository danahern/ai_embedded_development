title: 'bleak macOS: BLEDevice UUID expires between scans — use find_device helper'
body: 'On macOS, CoreBluetooth assigns UUIDs that can expire between BLE scan sessions. Passing a stale UUID string to `BleakClient(address)` raises `BleakDeviceNotFoundError`. Fix: always do a fresh `BleakScanner.discover()` and pass the `BLEDevice` object to `BleakClient(device)`. Use `return_adv=True` for advertisement data (RSSI). The `BLEDevice.rssi` attribute was removed in newer bleak versions.'
