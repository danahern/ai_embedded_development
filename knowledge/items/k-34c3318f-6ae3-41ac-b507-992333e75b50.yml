title: meta-alif requires meta-filesystems layer
body: The meta-alif Yocto BSP layer depends on meta-filesystems (from meta-openembedded). This is listed in meta-alif/README as a required layer. The STM32MP1 Yocto build does not need meta-filesystems, so it must be explicitly added to bblayers.conf for E7 builds. meta-filesystems is already available in our meta-openembedded clone.
