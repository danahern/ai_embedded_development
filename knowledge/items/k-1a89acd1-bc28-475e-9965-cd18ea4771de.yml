title: 'Yocto on Apple Silicon: reduce parallelism to avoid OOM on GCC build'
body: 'Docker Desktop for Mac defaults to ~8GB RAM. Building GCC cross-compiler with high parallelism (-j 12) causes OOM kills on gimple-match.cc (requires 4GB+ RAM to compile). Set BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4" and PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4" in local.conf. Also: gcc-multilib package is not available on ARM64 Ubuntu — not needed since Yocto builds its own cross-toolchain.'
