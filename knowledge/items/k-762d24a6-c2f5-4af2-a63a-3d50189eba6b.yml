title: STM32MP1 DK1 uses DK2 Zephyr board definition
body: |-
  The STM32MP157D-DK1 and STM32MP157C-DK2 share the same SoC (STM32MP157) and compatible pinout for M4 development. Zephyr only has a board definition for `stm32mp157c_dk2` — use this for DK1 hardware.

  Board qualifier: `stm32mp157c_dk2` (no /cpuapp suffix — single Zephyr target on M4).

  Differences between DK1 and DK2 are on the A7/Linux side (DK2 adds DSI display connector). M4 peripherals are identical.
