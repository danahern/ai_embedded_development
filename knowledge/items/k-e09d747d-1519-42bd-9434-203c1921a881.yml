title: 'Programmatic maintenance mode via ISP: START_ISP → SET_MAINTENANCE → STOP_ISP → RESET_DEVICE'
body: |-
  The SE can be put into maintenance mode programmatically over SE-UART without the interactive maintenance tool or physical RESET button.

  Sequence at 57600 baud on SE-UART:
  1. Send START_ISP (0x00) — wait for ACK (0xFE)
  2. Send SET_MAINTENANCE (0x16) — wait for ACK
  3. Send STOP_ISP (0x01) — wait for ACK
  4. Send RESET_DEVICE (0x09) — board reboots into maintenance mode

  This works when the SE is in normal running state (showing the spinner). All commands get ACKed. After reset, the board comes up in maintenance mode and app-write-mram works with full GET_REVISION support.

  Packet format: [length, cmd, checksum] where length = payload_len + 2, checksum = (0 - sum(all_bytes)) & 0xFF.
