title: 'STM32MP1: OpenSTLinux has dropbear SSH but it fails to start'
body: |-
  The OpenSTLinux 2.6 image for STM32MP157C-DK2 includes dropbear at /usr/sbin/dropbear but it does not start on boot and fails to start manually (silent failure, no process created). The host key exists at /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key. Dropbear -R flag fails with 'Failed moving key file: File exists'. Running without flags also silently fails. May need a proper systemd service or the binary may be broken in this image version. Needs further debugging.
