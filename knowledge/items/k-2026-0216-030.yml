title: 'MCP setup on new machine: build servers, symlink skills, restart'
body: |-
  When setting up the workspace on a new machine:

  1. **`.mcp.json` uses relative paths** — no path changes needed. It's checked into git and works on macOS, Linux, and WSL as-is.

  2. **Skills/commands need symlink** — create `.claude/commands` → `../claude-config/commands/` in the project root. Without this, `/start`, `/wrap-up`, `/learn`, `/recall`, `/embedded`, `/hw-verify` are unavailable.

  3. **Rust MCP servers must be built** — no pre-built binaries ship (they're platform-specific). Run `cargo build --release` in each server directory under `claude-mcps/`. Each server is an independent crate (no workspace Cargo.toml).

  4. **Python MCP venvs must be created** — `saleae-logic` and `hw-test-runner` need `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"` in their directories.

  5. **Restart Claude Code** after setup — MCP config is only read at startup.
