title: 'Alif E7 XIP boot chain: SE → TFA → xipImage (no U-Boot)'
body: 'The Alif E7 boot chain differs from STM32MP1: Secure Enclave → TF-A → xipImage. There is no U-Boot. The kernel runs XIP from MRAM (base 0x80020000) with DTB at 0x80010000. Root filesystem is cramfs-xip. Flashing requires Alif''s proprietary SETOOLS/ATOC to package images for the Secure Enclave. This is fundamentally different from STM32MP1''s dd-to-SD-card approach.'
