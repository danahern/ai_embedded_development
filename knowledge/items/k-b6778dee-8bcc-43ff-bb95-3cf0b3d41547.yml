title: 'STM32MP1 DK2 serial console: UART4 is A7 Linux, not M4'
body: |-
  On the STM32MP157C-DK2, the ST-Link VCP serial port (`/dev/cu.usbmodem1102`, 115200 baud) is connected to UART4 which is the A7 Linux console — not the M4 USART. This is where U-Boot, kernel boot messages, and the Linux login shell appear.

  The M4 console output is accessed via remoteproc trace on the A7: `cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/trace0`. No second serial cable is needed for M4 output.

  Jumpers JP4/JP5 on the DK2 route UART4 between ST-LINK and motherboard. Default is ST-LINK.
