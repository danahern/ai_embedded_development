title: shell_execute_cmd returns 1 when help is printed

body: |
  When a shell command has a NULL handler (parent with subcommands only), the shell prints subcommand help and returns `SHELL_CMD_HELP_PRINTED` (1), not 0. Tests must call the full subcommand path (e.g., `"board info"` not `"board"`).
