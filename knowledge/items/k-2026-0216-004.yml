title: Ralph Loop needs introspection/progress file before exit
body: |-
  Before exiting a Ralph Loop iteration, the agent should write a progress file (e.g., `tasks/progress.md` or update prd.json notes) that captures:

  1. What was accomplished this iteration
  2. What blocked or surprised
  3. What the next iteration should work on
  4. Any learnings or gotchas discovered

  This gives the next iteration (which starts with fresh context) the information it needs to pick up efficiently without re-discovering issues.

  The prd.json `notes` field on each user story serves part of this purpose, but a separate progress file with cross-cutting observations is also valuable.
